This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And then I added a server side end point by copying the code at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0
By Esau Silva, who I should totally follow on twitter.

After that, I learned that vs code has a native node debugger in it.  The way you see it is clicking on that left-side toolbar icon of a bug with a circle around it and then click on the gear button.  Mine had a red dot next to it indicating that I had never edited the debugging config file: launch.json.   When I clicked on it, I got a config object that sort of looked like it would debug node on the server side, but since I am running with Nodemon there's really no process for VS to start.  Instead, I followed
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/nodemon and now have this in my launch.json:

"configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "Node: Nodemon",
            "processId": "${command:PickProcess}",
            "restart": true,
            "protocol": "inspector"
        }
    ]

So, while node is running, I can go to that debug panel and hit the play button, and it presents me with a list of processes that I can attach to, and there is one for nodejs. If I refresh the browser I can hit a breakpoint on the server.
  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
